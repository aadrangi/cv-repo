        highlights:
          # Redesigned output files to contain the minimum required information, and designed a data conversion layer to turn files into standardized objects. This allowed us to cut down on code required for each workflow, while leaving room to quickly build new ones.
          - Spearheaded a software automation effort for an acoustic and vibration data test bench. Designed a codebase that incorporated structural calculations and slashed data review time from hours into seconds.
          - Lead the development of a test data pipeline to automate the processing of time series sensor data into tachometer adjusted frequency domain data. Automated hundreds of hours of manual processing while maintaining 97% uptime, and provided visualizations to analysts and Navy customers.
          - Updated and deployed a software platform that automated the transformation of acoustic/vibration data. Incorporated vibration and acoustic criteria, sensor processing requirements, and sensor categorization.
          - Redesigned a test data automation codebase from the ground up. Improvements to reliability, data portability and modularity resulted in a 500% hourly reduction in feature development efforts.  
          # percentage for uptime instead of 24/7, uptime measured by falling behind on 8 hours worth of data every 2 weeks due to uptime issues. 
          - Developed a database pipeline and significantly streamlined the integration of frequency domain data into systems simulation code. Implemented comprehensive unit testing to ensure data processing reliability.
          # quantify money and time saved
          # upper level of budget, how much money did you save the company. error reducts in the balance process save 75k per day (have to redo a whole days worth of testing)
          - Budgeted proposals for software automation projects with total savings of $150,000 per test campaign.
